# Record & Replay

Opt-in Linux integration for Record & Replay demo-to-skill workflows.

This feature stages the official `Record & Replay` bundled plugin shell from
the current upstream DMG when it is available, swaps the macOS helper for a
Linux `event-stream` helper, and keeps the fallback template aligned with that
same contract. The staged plugin launches `./bin/SkyLinuxComputerUseClient
event-stream mcp`; that helper is backed by the Rust
`codex-record-replay-linux` binary. The Rust helper records Linux workflow
evidence into a bundle, generates a skill-drafting prompt, and imports
generated skills as ordinary Codex skill folders.

It is disabled by default. Enable it in `linux-features/features.json`:

```json
{
  "enabled": [
    "record-and-replay"
  ]
}
```

## Build Prerequisite

When this feature is enabled, staging builds `codex-record-replay-linux` with
Cargo and copies the release binary into `resources/native/`, the staged plugin
`bin/codex-record-replay-linux`, and the official-shaped plugin helper alias
`bin/SkyLinuxComputerUseClient`. Builds without a Rust toolchain can set
`CODEX_RECORD_REPLAY_LINUX_SOURCE` to an executable prebuilt
`codex-record-replay-linux` binary.

## Behavior

- Records semantic evidence, not coordinate macro playback.
- Creates bundles with `manifest.json`, `timeline.jsonl`, screenshots,
  accessibility snapshots, browser trace evidence, transcript context,
  InputCapture/libei readiness, X11 session metadata, diagnostics, and
  `draft-prompt.md`.
- Writes a structured `backend_catalog` into the bundle manifest and a matching
  `backend_catalog` observation into the timeline so testers can see why
  InputCapture/libei or X11 paths are available or missing.
- Accepts browser/CDP-style trace JSON through the CLI, MCP, and Linux bridge
  as semantic evidence for skill drafting.
- Exposes the plugin as `Record & Replay` with MCP server `event-stream` and
  skill `record-and-replay`.
- Imports skills into `$HOME/.agents/skills` by default.
- Uses Linux Computer Use diagnostics to describe GUI readiness.
- Keeps replay skill-driven through Codex and available providers.
- Treats InputCapture/libei and X11 backend entries as readiness/evidence
  providers, not live coordinate macro replay.

## Tester Contract

Use the matrix in [docs/record-and-replay-linux.md](../../docs/record-and-replay-linux.md#tester-acceptance-matrix) for PR verification.

Minimum report data:

- Desktop environment.
- Session type.
- Computer Use doctor output.
- Provider readiness summary.
- Bundle path(s).
- Generated skill path and behavior.
- Any degradation, cap, stop, or cancel/discard notes.

## Bridge

The feature adds allowlisted bridge methods:

- `linux-record-replay-doctor`
- `linux-record-replay-status`
- `linux-record-replay-start`
- `linux-record-replay-mark`
- `linux-record-replay-speech-context`
- `linux-record-replay-browser-trace`
- `linux-record-replay-stop`
- `linux-record-replay-stop-active`
- `linux-record-replay-cancel`
- `linux-record-replay-cancel-active`
- `linux-record-replay-bundle`
- `linux-record-replay-draft-skill`
- `linux-record-replay-import-skill`
- `linux-record-replay-inspect-skill`

All helper invocations use `execFile` with fixed command shapes. The bridge does
not expose a shell or arbitrary argv surface.
