# Record & Replay

Record the user's Linux workflow, inspect the event stream, and turn the
repeatable intent into a reusable Codex skill. This is the same bundled
Record & Replay product shell backed by a Linux-native event-stream server,
not a raw pointer or keyboard macro recorder.

The bundled plugin launches `./bin/SkyLinuxComputerUseClient event-stream mcp`.
That helper is the Linux equivalent of the macOS Sky Computer Use event-stream
client, implemented by the Rust `codex-record-replay-linux` backend.

## Flow

1. Call `doctor` when readiness is uncertain. If Computer Use cannot observe the
   desktop, explain the blocker and offer the diagnostics/setup path before
   recording.
2. Call `event_stream_start` with a short `goal` when matching the upstream
   Record & Replay flow, or `start` when you need Linux-specific options. The
   Linux app should show the active Record & Replay recording HUD while the
   shared runtime status is active.
   Tell the user that recording is active, that they should perform the workflow
   normally, and that they can say `done` when finished.
3. During the demonstration, call `mark` only for meaningful intent boundaries
   that will help the future skill, such as "source page opened" or "finished
   selecting rows".
4. When the user speaks into the microphone or dictates guidance during the
   recording, call `speech_context` with the transcript. Treat the speech as
   user intent/context, not as audio to replay.
5. For browser workflows, call `browser_trace` when browser/CDP trace evidence
   is available. Treat the trace as semantic evidence for drafting the skill,
   not as a click/coordinate replay script.
6. Use `event_stream_status` or `status` if you need to confirm which bundle is
   active. When the user says they are done, asks to stop, or the HUD sends
   "I'm done recording.", call `event_stream_stop` or `stop` if the bundle is
   still active.
7. Call `validate_bundle`, then `draft_skill_prompt`.
8. Use the draft prompt and the bundle evidence to create or update a normal
   `SKILL.md`. Prefer stable app names, URLs, semantic UI labels, and data
   shape descriptions over literal coordinates.
9. Call `inspect_skill` before import. Call `import_skill` only after the user
   approves the generated skill.

## Guardrails

- Do not replay raw mouse coordinates or keystroke timing as the primary plan.
- Avoid exposing private captured content unless it is needed to describe the
  reusable workflow shape. This includes spoken transcript context.
- Keep generated skills source-aware: prefer browser DOM, APIs, files, and
  named UI controls before visual matching.
- If the workflow depends on unsupported Linux desktop capabilities, mark the
  skill conditional and include the Computer Use readiness path.
